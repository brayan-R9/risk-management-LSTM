Analyzing and providing different risk management strategies for different stocks based on the historical data of stocks and time period required.

LSTM models analyze historical stock price data to learn patterns and trends, which they then use to make predictions about future price movements. These models typically take as input a sequence of past stock prices and use it to predict the next price in the sequence. By training on historical data, LSTM models can learn to identify features and patterns that are indicative of future price movements. These models should only be used for broader investment strategies.

Tkinter will be used as the frontend of the project to allow users to explore stock market data, view predictions generated by LSTM models, and analyze risk-reward strategies. Hence by using Tkinter for frontend interface and LSTM for analyzing stocks and setting up strategies for risk management, this can act as a useful tool for many investors to obtain valuable insights and take accurate decisions.
